Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Here are the key principles:

1. Supervised Learning:
- Uses labeled data for training
- Examples include classification and regression
- Popular algorithms: Neural Networks, Random Forests, SVMs

2. Unsupervised Learning:
- Works with unlabeled data
- Focus on finding patterns and structures
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning:
- Learning through interaction with environment
- Based on rewards and penalties
- Applications: Game AI, Robotics

Best Practices:
- Data preprocessing is crucial
- Feature selection impacts model performance
- Cross-validation prevents overfitting
- Regular model evaluation and updates
